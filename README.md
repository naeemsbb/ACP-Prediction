AntiCancerPeptide-Finder (ACPF)


Overview


ACP-Finder (ACPF) is an innovative web application designed to predict the likelihood of peptides being anticancer or non-anticancer. Utilizing a sophisticated machine learning approach, ACPF leverages a Random Forest Classifier, trained on an extensive and balanced dataset, to deliver predictions with a high accuracy rate of 89%.

Key Features

Advanced Machine Learning Model: Employs a Random Forest Classifier, offering reliable and accurate predictions.
Peptide Structure Visualization: Features an interactive module to visualize the structure of anticancer peptides.
Feature Highlighting: Illuminates key features within the peptides, aiding in understanding the characteristics that contribute to their anticancer potential.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit, ACPF offers an intuitive and accessible platform for users to submit and analyze peptide sequences.

How it Works

Users can input peptide sequences directly or upload them in FASTA format. The application then processes these sequences, using a trained machine learning model to predict their anticancer potential. The results include both the likelihood and a classification label. Additionally, for peptides predicted as anticancer, ACPF provides a 3D structure visualization, enhancing the understanding of their molecular composition.

Technologies Used

Streamlit for the web interface
Pandas and Numpy for data handling
Joblib for model loading
Sklearn for the Random Forest Classifier
Pfeature for feature extraction
Py3Dmol and stmol for 3D molecular visualization
BioPython for sequence processing

Getting Started

To use ACPF, simply access the web application, input your peptide sequences, and let the tool evaluate their anticancer potential. The straightforward interface ensures ease of use, regardless of the user's technical background.
